## ðŸ“¦ What is This?

This is a native `.rpm` package of `ly`, the text-based (TUI) login manager, built specifically for **openSUSE** systems.  
The original project is no longer actively maintained, so I took matters into my own hands.

## ðŸ”¥ Features

- Fast and lightweight login UI (TTY-based)
- Perfect for **minimal setups**
- Built for **openSUSE Tumbleweed / Leap**
- ðŸ§  Your brain will get stronger figuring out PAM ðŸ«
